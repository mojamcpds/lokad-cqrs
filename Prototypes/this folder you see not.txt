This is not the folder you are looking for.

Since Lokad SAS is a company is internally focused on efficient research 
and development, we tend to produce a lot of prototypes and small utils 
along the way.

Normally this is a junk or some one-time experiments, but they get saved 
with the related project, JIC. This tends to save time once in a while. 
Storage is cheaper than time these days. 

Prototypes is the folder for this stuff in Lokad.CQRS project.


All the best,
